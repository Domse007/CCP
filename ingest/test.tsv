0	2000	What does that mean?
2000	4000	Short dead, yes.
4000	6000	Do we have more?
6000	8000	I don't know.
8000	10000	Holy shit!
12000	14000	No, I don't see one!
14000	16000	There's one more.
16000	18000	I don't know where he is.
18000	20000	So, David, the boost is an option, right?
20000	22000	Oh, you have the boxes behind you?
22000	24000	Yes.
24000	26000	Yes, I have the scaffold,
26000	28000	so that they can see it.
28000	30000	But I don't see him.
42000	44000	Nice.
44000	46000	One is on my right.
46000	48000	Here, one is coming.
50000	52000	No, there's more in the four.
52000	54000	No?
54000	56000	No.
56000	58000	Here, too.
58000	60000	That's just not...
60000	62000	You can't quantify that
62000	64000	with money.
64000	66000	That doesn't work, David.
66000	68000	The M2-49 is
68000	70000	the most powerful and the best.
72000	74000	I just say
74000	76000	troll.
76000	78000	Do you hear what a
78000	80000	intense troll is?
80000	82000	True.
86000	88000	Actually, true.
88000	90000	For example,
90000	92000	a deagle
92000	94000	costs $100 more.
96000	98000	I'm coming with you.
98000	100000	I'm coming with you.
100000	102000	Nice.
102000	104000	No bullet.
104000	106000	You should be tagged, probably immigration.
106000	108000	Nice.
110000	112000	Nice.
112000	114000	Nice.
114000	116000	He shoots second today.
116000	118000	Okay.
