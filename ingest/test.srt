1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What does that mean?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Short dead, yes.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Do we have more?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't know.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Holy shit!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, I don't see one!

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There's one more.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know where he is.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, David, the boost is an option, right?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, you have the boxes behind you?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, I have the scaffold,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so that they can see it.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But I don't see him.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Nice.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One is on my right.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here, one is coming.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No, there's more in the four.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here, too.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's just not...

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You can't quantify that

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
with money.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That doesn't work, David.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The M2-49 is

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the most powerful and the best.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I just say

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
troll.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Do you hear what a

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
intense troll is?

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
True.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Actually, true.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For example,

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
a deagle

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
costs $100 more.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm coming with you.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm coming with you.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Nice.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No bullet.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You should be tagged, probably immigration.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Nice.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Nice.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Nice.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He shoots second today.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.
