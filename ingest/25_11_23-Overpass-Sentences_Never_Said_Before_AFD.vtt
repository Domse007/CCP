00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah, I guess so. Why lol?

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
Roman is, I quote, and it's really not extra.

00:23.000 --> 00:43.000
It wasn't the opponent, nailed it.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Too much still.

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
Aha, now you're talking about TKs.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You can't be serious.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
At least I do enough, little damage.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Because it's team damage. At least I do enough, little team damage.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Dude, too much still.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
That's not an argument.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
What was that? I didn't even expect this context.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I expected the context of grandmother.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And it's really not extra.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Aha, like that. It's really not extra.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
The only time...

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes, yes.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
It's really not extra. The only time he really stood between the opponent.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
There I just saw something moving and panicked.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, Dash, it wasn't the opponent.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
But I remember a Vertigo clip.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
And there you are.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Basically standing on the headshot angle.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
He was Genny. He was on AFD.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
And then he flies.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
On you.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And then he flies.
