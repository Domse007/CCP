1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, I guess so. Why lol?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Roman is, I quote, and it's really not extra.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It wasn't the opponent, nailed it.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Too much still.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Aha, now you're talking about TKs.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You can't be serious.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
At least I do enough, little damage.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because it's team damage. At least I do enough, little team damage.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dude, too much still.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's not an argument.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What was that? I didn't even expect this context.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I expected the context of grandmother.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And it's really not extra.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Aha, like that. It's really not extra.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The only time...

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, yes.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's really not extra. The only time he really stood between the opponent.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There I just saw something moving and panicked.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, Dash, it wasn't the opponent.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But I remember a Vertigo clip.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And there you are.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Basically standing on the headshot angle.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He was Genny. He was on AFD.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And then he flies.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On you.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then he flies.
