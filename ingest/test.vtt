00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What does that mean?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Short dead, yes.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Do we have more?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I don't know.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Holy shit!

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
No, I don't see one!

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
There's one more.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I don't know where he is.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
So, David, the boost is an option, right?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Oh, you have the boxes behind you?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Yes.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Yes, I have the scaffold,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
so that they can see it.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
But I don't see him.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Nice.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
One is on my right.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Here, one is coming.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
No, there's more in the four.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
No?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
No.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Here, too.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
That's just not...

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You can't quantify that

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
with money.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
That doesn't work, David.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
The M2-49 is

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
the most powerful and the best.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I just say

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
troll.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Do you hear what a

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
intense troll is?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
True.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Actually, true.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
For example,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
a deagle

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
costs $100 more.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm coming with you.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm coming with you.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Nice.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
No bullet.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
You should be tagged, probably immigration.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Nice.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Nice.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Nice.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
He shoots second today.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Okay.
